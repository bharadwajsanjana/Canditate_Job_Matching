Other Accomplishments

Last year I was asked to administer the GATE after school program. Together, the GATE identified students and I, created a school newspaper.
We named it the Jr Journal and invented five topics that would be in every issue. I helped create an outline and template that our reporters could
follow and eventually do independently. Each student chose a different topic every month and would either interview or research to write an article
for that section. They would then write a rough draft, that I would edit, and then they would type the final draft and put it into the newspaper
template. Students would also have a chance to find graphics or take pictures that fit their topic. It turned out great and we were able to publish
four issues. This will be our second year. This was a great accomplishment for me as an educator, because I love to write and was in my school
newspaper in High School. I had the chance to share a passion of mine and see students enjoy coming in after school and put their advanced
brains to work. It was such a great experience and can't wait to have that again this year.","E ducator: People skills, always looking for ways to grow as a person and educator, communicates, eager to learn, eager to teach, encouraging, enthusiasti c, great organizational skills, great with colleagues and parents, loves to teach students how to ""love to learn"", problem-solve r, sets high and clear expectations for students, technology savvy"

order of operations. Since the students were newly familiar with the information we wanted them to get some practice working on various
problems using multiple operations. We played â€œI have, who has?â€​ As each student read their equation to the class I would write it on the
board so that they could visualize it and write it down. Students would call out the answer when it was their card and then we solved the problem
on the board as a class before we moved on to the next card. The students really enjoyed this because it was something that we did all together
